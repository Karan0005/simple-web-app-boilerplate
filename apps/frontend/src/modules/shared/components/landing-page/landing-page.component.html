                    <p class="mt-auto">
                        A robust upgrade command handles the complex task of upgrading Angular,
                        NestJS, NX Workspace, and npm dependencies. If any issues arise during the
                        upgrade, it automatically rolls back to the previous stable state.

                        Includes interactive commands to scaffold modules for both frontend and
                        backend projects, along with a common library for shared resources
                        (constants, interfaces, enumerations), promoting reusability and efficiency
                        in development.
